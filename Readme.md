Notes Application
This is a simple Notes Application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The notes are stored locally in the browser using localStorage, ensuring that they persist even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.

Features
Create new notes by clicking the "Create Notes" button.
Each note is editable in-place using the contenteditable feature.
Delete a note by clicking the delete icon  on each note.
All notes are saved to the browser's localStorage, ensuring they persist across sessions.
Line breaks are handled when pressing "Enter" while editing the notes.
